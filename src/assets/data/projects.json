                "description": "NITRO is a powerful tool for building complex image processing routines. Instead of needing to modify source code or scripts to process images in different ways, you can use this visual node editor to do that instead. The project was developed with extendability in mind, making it easy to add your own types nodes, and widgets. For more information on this, read the docs. The UI was inspired by Blender's Shader Editor. The project was originally developed for my Master thesis at the University of Groningen. That is also the origin of the name NITRO: Niels' Image-processing Thesis on Reconstruction Operations.",
