                NITRO is a powerful tool for building complex image-processing routines in a non-destructive manner. The
                project was developed and designed with extensibility in mind, which means that it is easy to define custom nodes,
                data types, or even custom GUI widgets.

                    At its core, NITRO is a visual node editor, meaning that the user can construct a custom graph of
                    nodes to create their own pipeline. When building a new image processing pipeline, one often uses
                    existing building blocks. This is where NITRO shines: it comes with a large collection of these
                    building blocks in the form of nodes, ranging from simple transform and blend operations to more
                    complex filters or frequency domain transforms.

                    NITRO was built using C++, Qt, CMake, and OpenGL. It uses OpenCV as the backbone for its image
                    representation and the QtNodes library to do the heavy lifting of the visual graph representation.
                    However, a significant number of changes to this library were required in order to get the desired
                    qualities. As such, I created a custom fork containing these numerous modifications. The GUI of
                    NITRO was inspired by Blenderâ€™s Shader Editor given its user-friendliness and flexibility.

                    The project was originally developed for my Master's thesis at the University of
                    Groningen. That is also the origin of the name NITRO: Niels' Image-processing Thesis on
                    Reconstruction Operations.
